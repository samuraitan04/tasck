**problem Statement**

Many people struggle with managing large or complex tasks because they can feel
overwhelming and difficult to approach. Breaking down these tasks into smaller,
actionable steps is often a time-consuming process. The lack of a clear structure can
lead to confusion, procrastination, and decreased productivity. 

**solution**

This app will be used to address these challenges by automatically dividing a task into smaller sub-tasks, which
can be further broken down as needed. By providing a structured, step-by-step
approach, users can focus on completing smaller tasks at a manageable pace while
maintaining visibility of their overall goals. This will not only improve productivity and
task completion rates but also reduce the anxiety that comes with large, undefined
tasks, making it easier for individuals and teams to stay organized and motivated
